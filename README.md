# NeoFly-Mission-creator
A little tool you can use with Microsoft Flight Simulator career addon: NeoFly to create missions in order to fly with your friends.

This package require the .Net framework (min version: 4.7.2)

## Where can I download?
The last release available is located here: https://github.com/sbeuh34/NeoFly-Mission-creator/releases/tag/release-1.0.0

## How it works.
 - First backup your database just in case. (I didn't faced any db issue, but if Neofly updates its missions database model it could lead to some corruption)
 - Simply unzip the folder and launch the tool with "NeoFly Mission Creator.exe" file.
 - Link your db file location into the "Database File" field if not located in the default C:\ProgramData\NeoFly\common.db
 - Copy the same info as your mate mission (departure, arrival, distance, mission Type...)
 - Click "Create Mission"
 - You can then simply hit the "search" button once again on NeoFly UI mission tab and the new mission appears.

When flying a tourrist or emergency mission you have to enter the Target latitude and target longitude (your mate can see them on the bing map into Neofly UI)
